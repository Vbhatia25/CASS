## Project Title
Consumer Attributes and Satisfaction Assessment System (CASS)


## Description

It is an IOT system which can make good predictions about the physiological attributes of the user and analyze emotional responses prominently. The system uses  an IP camera coupled with a raspberry pi which runs the facial recognition algorithm on the consumers. For accurate estimation of emotions and consumer age, a convolutional neural network has been implemented on the raspberry pi which can determine the consumer contentment index. This index is a measure of the user satisfaction which can form an essential component for strategic market penetration.
